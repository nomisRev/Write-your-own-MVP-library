# Write your own Android MVP library

With all the MVP hype lately lets talk about what MVP is and how you can create your very own library that is perfect for your requirements.

Because everyone and every team has specific preferences or setups I recommend developing your own MVP implementation. Then you can code it to your liking and customize it to the needs of your project or team. Writing a full MVP implementation will seem like a lot of work but it really is not. As a bonus you will really understand what is going on instead of relying on someone else's library without knowing what is going down under the hood.

## What is MVC/MVP & why would you use it.

* Some people may be more familiar with the term MVC from other languages or frameworks. There is a small difference between MVP and MVC but more about that below. First we will analyze the different components in MVC/MVP and how they interact.

* Model: The model is an abstract model that organizes elements. In other words the model is used to store and retrieve data. The model doesn't know anything about the views and controllers.
* View: The view is being presented to the user and the component that the user uses to interact with the app.
* Controller: The controller/presenter is the decision maker and the glue between the model and view. The controller updates the view when the model changes.

#### Controller versus Presenter
* From the above explanation it is clear that both Controller and Presenter are the middle man between the model and the view.

* Let us analyze what happens here. As you can see the controller does three things.
    1. A controller can be in control of multiple views, and thus is responsible for which view to display.
    2. The controller is the middle man between communication between the views and the model.
    3. The controller takes care of logic.

* When we compare the presenter to the controller we can see there is one key difference, and this will clarify why I prefer Presenter over Controller in Android. The controller is/may be responsible for which view to display. So one controller can map to more Views. A presenter does not have this responsibility, a presenter maps one on one with the view. Why this is important is explained below.


#### Why would you use it?
* It allows for a loosely coupled architecture. Loosely coupled systems have tons of benefits but that topic is out of the scope of this article. Here are 2 benefits (among many more) to give you an idea why you'll love this in your code.
    * Allow simultaneous work between developers who are responsible for different components (such as UI layer and core logic). In most cases the model is defined at the start of the project, once the model is known you can define a contract between the view and presenter. Now the developers know how the communication between the presenter and view is defined and thus don't need to know how it is implemented.
    * Separation of view logic from business logic. Allowing for interchangeable components and implementations.

## How does this translate to Android?

* As might be clear, MVP is better suited for Android. A good reason for this is keeping the Presenter free of android package imports as a result for not being responsible for changing views. This makes it perfect for interchanging it with other Java projects. And making it easier to be unit tested.
* Let's say we would use a controller. We would have to give it a reference to the activity context in order to switch to a different activity. Now on a switch of activity we'd need to replace the old context reference to the new activities context references. Writing that sentence already felt like a hassle. So let's avoid that.

* Presenter: Holds our business logic.
* View: Our view is responsible for visualizing the model to the user.

## Basic example

There are a couple of decisions we need to make. These are the ones I prefer and will demonstrate/explain in this article.
    * The Presenter is lifecycle free.
    * We do not retain the presenter over config change.
    * The presenter class should have no android package imports.

#### The contract
* First let's create the contract between the View and the Presenter.

```java
public interface MVPContract {
    interface MainView {
       void showData(Data dataObject);
    }
    interface MainPresenter {
        void getData();
        void attachView(MainView view);
        void detachView();
    }
}
```

* View: In our basic example we want our View to show some `Data`.
* Presenter: We want our Presenter to do several things.
    * Retrieve dataObject from somewhere
    * Attach the View
    * Detach the View (to avoid activity leaks)

#### View implementation (Activity)
* The activity is our View and thus it must implement MainView.
* The activity needs to create our Presenter.
    1. We must create our Presenter in our View because of Android lifecycle so in `onCreate` we'll create our Presenter. `presenter = new MainPresenter();`
    2. Our must Presenter must have a reference to our View so we'll attach the view `presenter.attachView(this)`.
    3. From this point on we have a Presenter and we can rely on it for logic.
    4. In `onDestroy()` we'll detach the view since it won't exist anymore after this point.
* We now have a Presenter so we can use it to do what was defined in the contract. So let's call `presenter.getData()`, we are not interested in waiting until it returns. It will notify the View when it needs to show something.
* Implement the View's contract methods

#### Presenter implementation
The Presenter is pretty straight forward if you're familiar with Java.
* A constructor
* Implement attachView/detachView, respectively store and clear the reference to the View.
* Implement the contract methods.

## Abstract the code and make a library

* We now have a concrete implementation of an MVP architecture, but it's not really a library yet, is it? So let's abstract it to something we can add to every project.

#### View

* Our View is our Activity. Here's the list of things it does:
`public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements MVPContract.MainView {`
    1. We implement our `MVPContract.MainView` to ensure our MVP View upholds its contract.
    2. The activity holds a reference to the `Presenter`
    3. Create the `Presenter` in `onCreate` and attach ourself to it.
    4. In `onDestroy` we detach ourself.

* This is the minimum functionality we need for every View. To ensure this we create a `BaseMVPContract` with a `BaseMvpView` and an abstract class `BaseMvpActivity` we extend from to create our `Views`.
* Our `BaseMvpView` doesn't require any initial functionality because it's only responsible for showing data. Showing data is case specific so it becomes an empty interface.

```java
public interface BaseMVPContract {
    interface BaseMvpView {}
}
```

* The `BaseMvpActivity` needs to hold a reference to the `Presenter` and a way to create that `Presenter`. In order to know what type the `Presenter` is let's ask for it with generics.

```java
public abstract class BaseMvpActivity<P extends BaseMVPContract.BasePresenter> extends AppCompatActivity implements BaseMVPContract.BaseMvpView {

    protected P presenter;

    protected abstract @NonNull P createPresenter();
```

* Now we have our `Presenter` and a way to create it so lets do so in `onCreate`.

```java
@Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable final Bundle savedState) {
        super.onCreate(savedState);
        presenter = createPresenter();
        //noinspection unchecked
        presenter.attachView(this);
    }
```

**Beware!!! Since we don't know what actual type our View is yet, and neither does our `BasePresenter` we will have to cast our `BaseMvpView` to the actual type. Purposely mismatching the View will cause an `ClassCastException`. //noinspection unchecked`**

* We need to do one more thing and that is detach ourself in `onDestroy`

```java
@Override
protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    presenter.detachView();
}
```

#### Presenter

* Our `Presenter` as you can see from our previous written code needs some base functionality. It needs functionality to attach **a** `BaseMvpView` and detach it. Let's translate this to our `BaseMvpContract`.
* In order to know **what** `BaseMvpView` we need to attach we'll ask for the type with generics.

```java
public interface BaseMVPContract {
    interface BaseMvpView {}

    interface BasePresenter<V extends BaseMvpView> {
        void attachView(V view);
        void detachView();
    }
}
```

* Now we either have to implement that in every `Presenter` or we can define the base functionality in an abstract class.
* This is where you define the minimal requirements for your `Presenter`. We want a reference to `V` in order to communicate to our `BaseMvpView` through our contract. And we need to define functionality to attach and detach our `BaseMvpView`.

```java
public abstract class BasePresenter<V extends BaseMVPContract.BaseMvpView> implements BaseMVPContract.BasePresenter<V> {

    protected V view;

    @Override
    public void attachView(V view) {
        this.view = view;
    }

    @Override
    public void detachView() {
        view = null;
    }
}
```

**In lib-example you can find a master-detail example of how to use your newly written library.**

## Highly customizable and your own responsibility

Some of us prefer the idea of being in control of our architecture. Because you wrote it yourself, if something goes wrong no-one else is to blame. But more importantly because you wrote it yourself you know exactly what is going on and in my experience it's less error prone. Every library has a learning curve because you don't know the code base, nor do you know all the functionality unless you spend time getting familiar with all of it.
